    info: "Born originally in a small town in Southern Italy in the last twenty years of the 20th century, Vincenzo Arena started pretty soon to get himself into arts and science. Deeply in love with animation, movies, video games and comics. His passion for puzzles and building blocks, and all the time spent in front of a computer, led him to Web Development, after moving to Berlin in 2013.",

    info: "After many years wandering around the new world, going in and out of the cryogenic chamber living on slow planets, so that the years would not wreak havoc, he managed to reconnect with Loren and Vince, whom he had not seen since the beginning of the destruction for the years of the pandemic and war when, due to things in life they took a course together that brought them to what they do today. His experience in tourism added to Vince's engineering and Lorenz's ideas and ease of solving problems brought them to this point of forming this great intergalactic company in which they put together their passions and our hobbies, so that the rest of humanity can enjoy without limitations of outer space! Happy journey",
