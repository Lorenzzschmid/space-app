    info: "Born in times before private space-travel and bios-enhancement, Lorenz Schmid managed to freeze his remains with a certain optimism for future technological development. After a successful rescue of parts of his neuronal structure he had his first contact with space-travel through the funding of a small news agency, responsible for spreading information throughout the solar-System. After a couple of cerebral malfunctions, Doctors urged the implementation of recent neuro-biological implants. Short after a successful surgery Lorenz Schmid sold his enterprise and went for the funding of Stellar Trips with his colleges and Friends Vincenzo Arena and Miguel Wicke, the company managed to grow unexpectedly fast and has since then a de facto monopolistic status in space travel. Lorenz Schmid developed the space communication operating system and is deeply involved in securing the IT structure of the Intra-Solar-Network from constant threats. ",

    info: "After many years wandering around the new world, going in and out of the cryogenic chamber living on slow planets, so that the years would not wreak havoc, he managed to reconnect with Loren and Vince, whom he had not seen since the beginning of the destruction for the years of the pandemic and war when, due to things in life they took a course together that brought them to what they do today. His experience in tourism added to Vince's engineering and Lorenz's ideas and ease of solving problems brought them to this point of forming this great intergalactic company in which they put together their passions and our hobbies, so that the rest of humanity can enjoy without limitations of outer space! Happy journey",
