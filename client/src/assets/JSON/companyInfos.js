      info: "2140, Earth has become the base of operation for the colonization of the solar system. The new discovery in the field of space travels, new impulse and warp engines, artificial gravity generators, teleportation devices, made for Humankind easier to finally discover and start connecting with new intelligent life forms. The new technologies in the field of human clonation, and recording, storing and implanting of cerebral patterns and memories, opened up the doors of a new endless life for all humanity. In this year three men from the 21st century were brought back and they met at a convention on new technologies held by the Mars Colonial Society, a company who was building the first orbital station around the red planet. After talking together about their ideas on the possibilities for the development of the colonization process and his commercial potential, they decided to found STELLAR TRIPS Inc. December 13th 2143 was the inauguration day of STELLAR TRIPS Inc. first office on Earth, in Berlin, Germany. Few months later the three founders, Miguel Wicke, Lorenz Schmid and Vincenzo Arena, presented their programs to build orbital space stations around each planet of the solar system and, in some cases, also around some of their moons. Next step would have been building bases on the planetsâ€™ surface. Since then billions of tourists used our company services to enjoy the life on other planets who are now some of the most beloved holidays location, offering many different attractions, activities and accommodations.",
