The station constantly moves against the spinning direction of the planet on the edge of shadow with the glimmering heat of the Sun flickering on the horizon. We even manage to have our mobile gardens safely positioned moving in front of the station where enough light makes them grow and heat is still bearable. This facility provides our guests with an endless sunset or if you prefer an endless dawn. Our moving hotel facility “Dusk til Dawn” comes with three types of accommodations, Budget, Plus and Deluxe.",

The well planned and costly operation, based on the Theories of Carl Edward Sagan failed on multiple levels and after a decade of disappointments, even catastrophic results with a high amount of human losses led to the conviction of the impossibility of the project. Since then the operation has been buried. The only achievement of the cooperation between the Mars-Society and Stellar-Trips inc. was the “House Of Hades” a heat resistant modular Station that generates its own power and materials out of the same hell like environment surrounding it - until the day it is the most efficient station in the solar-system which explains its fast expansion. The initial insignificant status of this station turned fast into a sub cultural meet and greet and is even home to a couple of well known Rock and metal groups, who perform exclusive Events inside a huge transparent cupola under the firestorms of Venus and the shadows of the “House Of Hades” that hosts Venus travelers from all over the Solar system. The west branch of the station has it's own flair, with a clandestine atmosphere of coffee shops the famous red-light-district music clubs and restaurants. The opening of “The Roman Baths”, were an attempt to change the despicable reputation of the station but the extension of the spa area lead - due to employment shortages - to the merge of the red-light-district and the “Holiday Spa” areal.",
